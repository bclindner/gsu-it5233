# IT 5233 (Web & Mobile Security Fundamentals) Coursework

This repository represents the bulk of the work i did for the Web & Mobile Security Fundamentals course at Georgia Southern University, which teaches basic penetration testing of web applications, common attack vectors, and hardening a web app against attacks. the course was taught by Dr. Russell Thackston in the spring semester of 2018.

The class consisted primarily of one project through which most of the course content was taught - a rough, simple PHP web app that serves as a sort of discussion forum, initially using very insecure practices and libraries (like raw unsanitized MySQL queries and flimsy session tokens). It was then improved, piece by piece, vulnerability by vulnerability, until it resembled something of a well-defended Web app (though the class did skip some major vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting).

I kept most of the work organized through this Git repository. While the site is by no means fully protected, this repository shows my work in the course learning about - and learning how to defend against - more obvious attack vectors.
