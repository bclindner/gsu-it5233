# IT 5233 (Web & Mobile Security Fundamentals) Coursework

this repository represents the bulk of the work i did for the Web & Mobile Security Fundamentals course at Georgia Southern University, which teaches basic penetration testing of web applications, common attack vectors, and hardening a web app against attacks. the course was taught by dr. russell thackston in the spring semester of 2018.

the class consisted primarily of one project through which most of the course content was taught - a rough, simple PHP web app that serves as a sort of discussion forum, initially using very insecure practices and libraries (like raw unsanitized MySQL queries and flimsy session tokens).
